   <center><h2><i>DETECT THE FAKE PRODUCT USING BLOCK CHAIN</i></h2></center>
   <pre>
    <h3><u>ABSTRACT :</u></h3>
      In recent years,conterfeit products are play an implement role in product manufacturing industries.
      This affects the companies name,sales,and profit of the companies.
      BlockChain technology is udes to identification of real products and detects fake products.
      BlockChain technology is distributed ,decentralized,and digitel ledger that stores the transactional information in the form of blocks
      in many databases whuch is connected with the chains.

    <h3><u>Block Chain Working :</u></h3>
   <dt><u>The contents:</u></dt>
   <dd>This are used for verifyple in bitcoin are the Bitcoin transactions and the miner incentive reward.</dd>
   <dt><u>Headers:</u></dt>
   <dd>which contain the data about the block. It includes some technical information about the block,
    a reference to the previous block, and a fingerPrint(hash) of the data contained in the block.
   </dd>

    <dt><u>Block by block:</u></dt>
    <dd>In blockChain,each block have previous block address and previous block have its previous
        block address till genesis block.
    </dd>
</dl>
<h3><U>CRYPTOCURRENCY:</U></h3>
<pre>Because of the random nature of hashing,achieving an acceptable block is never a guarantee.
    Thus,Bitcoin mining is a competitive venture,where miners are awarded new Bitcoin for each
    block successfully hashed and accepted in the blockChain.

    <h3><u>Public BlockChain:</U></h3>
      It has below 2 basic properties:
      <li>Anyone,without permission granted by another authority,can write data.</li>
      <li>Anyone,without permission granted by another authority,can real data.</li>
      <h3><u>Private BlockChain:</u></h3>
      <pre>Private BlockChain provides a network where participants are known and trusted in which many 
        rules/protocol aren't needed as participants will behave properly because he has signed this piece of paper.
        They do not rely on anonymous nodes to validate transactions.
